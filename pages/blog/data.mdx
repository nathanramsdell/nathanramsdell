# Fetching Posts

None of our components will work if we don't have data to pass to it. We will be utilizing a free api for dummy json called [Dummy JSON](https://dummyjson.com/).

## Fetch
1. We can create a function that will handle our posts fetch call. Since this is only an example project, we will not be doing any error handling. I would normally wrap this API call in a ```try{ } catch () { }``` block. We can create a ```load-posts()``` function and place it in ```/lib/load-posts.js```. It would look something like this.
    ```js filename="/lib/load-posts.js" copy
    export async function loadPosts() {
    // Calling external api
    const res = await fetch('https://dummyjson.com/posts?limit=0')
    const posts = await res.json()
    
    return posts
    }
    ```

2. Then lets call this function in a ```getStaticProps()``` function in our ```/pages/index.js``` page and return the post data.
    ```js filename="/pages/index.js" copy
    export async function getStaticProps() {
        // we dont have to fetch our api but instead call it here
        const posts = await loadPosts()

        return { props: { posts }}
    }
    ```
    The data returned will look something like this.
    ```json
        {
        "posts": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "title": "His mother had always taught him",
                "body": "His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He'd tried to live by this motto. He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind.",
