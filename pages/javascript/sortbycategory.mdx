# Sorting Objects

## Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to sort through an object and group them by a selected value.

I was tasked with upgrading and overhauling a webpage buit with **NextJs**. This page showcased a list of sponsors in an image grid seperated by sponsor category. This only issue with this was that all the images lived on the site! This meant that anytime a changed was needed, updates to the code base had to be made.

## Approach
Here were my initial must haves for this upgrade

* Needed to be DRY ("don't repeat yourself")
* Images shouldn't be living within the website itself
* Each brand image should be listed in the correct category
* The brands should be in alphabetical order based on brand name

```js filename="demo.js" {3} copy
function getbrandsByCategory(brandsArray) {
    const brandsByCategory = {};
    brandsArray.forEach(brand => {
      if (brandsByCategory.hasOwnProperty(brand.metadata.licensee_type.value)) {
        brandsByCategory[brand.metadata.licensee_type.value].push(brand)
      } else {
        brandsByCategory[brand.metadata.licensee_type.value] = [brand];
      }
    });
    return brandsByCategory
  }
```
