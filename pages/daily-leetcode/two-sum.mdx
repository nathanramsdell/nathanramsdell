# Two Sum - Easy




## Approach
The way I approached this problem was by first coming up with a solution to see what numbers we were looking for. My initial thought was to loop through the the given `nums{:js}` array and check running a simple check if the array contians the necessary value. I then relaized that my proposed solution would take up too much time iterating through each number and would also cause a lot of repeating actions.

I instead opted to create a Map() to store the key value pairs of index and value. I wanted to use `Map(){:js}` since I can utilize its .has() function to check if the Map contains the value im looking for while I iterate through the array. This means that I only have to iterate once through the `nums` array. 

```js {3} copy
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {  
    // Declaring a new Map
    const seen = new Map()
};
```

Now all we have to do is create a for loop and iterate through the nums array and check if out `seen` Map() contains the value we are looking for. If it does we can return the function with the `[index, seen.get(lookingFor)]{:js}`. 

```js {9} copy
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {  
    // Declaring a new set
    const seen = new Map()

    //Looping through givin array
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        const lookingFor = target - nums[i]
        if(seen.has(lookingFor)){
            return [[i], seen.get(lookingFor)]
        }   
    }
};
```

If it wasn't found add the current key value pairs to our map.

```js {11} copy
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {  
    // Declaring a new set
    const seen = new Map()

    //Looping through givin array
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        const lookingFor = target - nums[i]
        if(seen.has(lookingFor)){
            return [[i], seen.get(lookingFor)]
        }  
        seen.set(nums[i], i)  
    }
};
```

After the iteration, if no pairs are found return and empty array
```js {13} copy
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {  
    // Declaring a new set
    const seen = new Map()

    //Looping through givin array
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        const lookingFor = target - nums[i]
        if(seen.has(lookingFor)){
            return [[i], seen.get(lookingFor)]
        }  
        seen.set(nums[i], i)  
    }
    return []
};
```

## Complexity

### Time Complexity
O(n) - worse case, there are no pairs and we have to iterate over every single item; fetching items from a map is O(1)

### Space Complexity
O(n) - we are using map to store the pairs

## Code

```js copy
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {  
    // Declaring a new set
    const seen = new Map()

    //Looping through givin array
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        const lookingFor = target - nums[i]
        if(seen.has(lookingFor)){
            return [[i], seen.get(lookingFor)]
        }  
        seen.set(nums[i], i)  
    }
    return []

};
```
