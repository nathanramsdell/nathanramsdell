# Next.js
Here you will find helpful information related to coding in Next.js. You will find styling guides or adding functionality onto a Next.js application. Anything I find useful will be added to here to reference for future projects. Of course, languages and bests practices will change and I will continue to update the pages as new information comes about. Feel free to fork this repository and make updates as you see fit.
